# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

## Overview

Welcome!
In this repo, I have used my newly learned Java skills alongside some personal loads of research to create code for a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers/

### Acceptance Criteria

To create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

- A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.

  - Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  - When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  - If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

- The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  - When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
